This rule applies to the 'Driving-Lesson Tracker (PWA)' project, a Progressive Web Application built with React, TypeScript, Material-UI, and Dexie (for IndexedDB). The app allows driving instructors to track student lessons, topics, and durations offline, storing data locally. Apply rules related to this project when: (1) Modifying core data structures for students or lessons (defined in DrivingDB/Dexie schema), (2) Implementing or changing features related to adding, editing, or deleting students/lessons, (3) Working with the `useDrivingStore` custom hook for data management, (4) Updating UI components (`AppShell`, `StudentList`, `StudentForm`, `LessonTimeline`, `ProgressBars`, `ExportImportDialog`) or implementing new ones using Material-UI, (5) Adjusting PWA functionalities like the service worker (`vite-plugin-pwa`), offline capabilities, or the web manifest, (6) Modifying data export/import logic (JSON format), (7) Implementing future enhancements like multi-instructor support, cloud sync, or data encryption. Following project-specific rules ensures consistency in state management, data handling with IndexedDB/Dexie, component structure, and adherence to the offline-first PWA architecture.
