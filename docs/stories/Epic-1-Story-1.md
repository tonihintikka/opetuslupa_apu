# Epic-1 - Story-1

Project Setup and Configuration

**As a** developer
**I want** a properly configured React project with TypeScript and Material-UI
**so that** I can develop the Driving-Lesson Tracker application efficiently with modern tools

## Status

In Progress

## Context

This is the first story in the project, focusing on establishing the technical foundation for the Driving-Lesson Tracker PWA. A proper setup with the right tools and configurations is essential for efficient development and code quality throughout the project. 

The decisions made in this story will impact all subsequent development efforts, so careful consideration of technology choices and project structure is critical.

## Dev Notes

- Chose Vite over Create React App due to faster build times and better development experience
- Selected MUI v5 for its comprehensive component library and theming capabilities
- Configured ESLint with the Airbnb preset as a starting point, with customizations for project needs
- Set up strict TypeScript configuration to catch potential issues early in development
- Added path aliases to avoid excessive relative imports
