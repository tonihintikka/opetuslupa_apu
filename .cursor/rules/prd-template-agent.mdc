- Mermaid diagrams should be used for data models and workflows where applicable
- Keep a detailed change log that tracks significant modifications to requirements
- Version numbers must follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Include clear and specific KPIs to measure project success
- Document must transition from "Draft" to "Approved" before development begins

## PRD Template

```markdown
# 1. Title: PRD for Driving-Lesson Tracker (PWA)

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Status: { Draft | Approved }

## Intro

Driving-Lesson Tracker is a Progressive Web Application designed to help driving instructors track their students' progress, lesson details, and driving minutes in an offline-first approach. This PRD defines the requirements, features, and goals for developing a privacy-focused, easy-to-use application that works across desktop and mobile devices, with all data processing and storage happening directly on the client.

## Goals

- Create an intuitive interface for tracking driving lessons and student progress
- Ensure full offline functionality with data persistence in browser
- Enable installation on mobile devices as a PWA
- Provide export/import capabilities for data backup and transfer
- Support tracking of lesson topics, driving minutes, and student notes
- Minimize learning curve for non-technical driving instructors
- Create a responsive design that works equally well on desktop and mobile
- Ensure data privacy by storing all information locally

## Features and Requirements

- **Offline-First Operation**
  - Application must function without internet connection
  - All data must be stored locally in the browser
  - Changes must sync with local storage immediately

- **Student Management**
  - Add, edit, and delete student profiles
  - Track contact information and notes
  - View comprehensive student history

- **Lesson Tracking**
  - Record lesson date, duration, and topics covered
  - Add instructor notes for each lesson
  - View lessons in chronological order

- **Progress Visualization**
  - Display total driving minutes per student
  - Show topic coverage statistics
  - Highlight areas needing more practice

- **Data Portability**
  - Export all data as JSON
  - Import data from exported file
  - Data validation during import process

- **Progressive Web App**
  - Installable on mobile devices
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes
  - App icon and splash screen
  - Offline capabilities via service worker

## Data Models, API Specs, Schemas, etc...

### Student Entity

```typescript
interface Student {
  id?: string;       // Auto-generated UUID if not provided
  name: string;      // Student's full name
  email?: string;    // Optional contact email
  notes?: string;    // Optional additional notes
  createdAt: Date;   // When the student record was created
}
```

### Lesson Entity

```typescript
interface Lesson {

# PRD - Driving App

This document describes what we want to build.

## Features

We need to track students and lessons. Students should have profiles and we should track lesson details.

## Technologies

We'll use React and some database.

## Stories

1. Set up project
2. Add student tracking
3. Add lesson tracking

## Notes

Will need to think about offline support later.
